### App Name

> I'm developing an app for HIIT exercises, what would be some good names for it?

I ended up using none of the names, but came up with my own based on the types of wordplay it came up with.

### Exercises

> What exercises could one do in their living room?

The workouts were split into: warm-up, strength, and cool-down exercises. I used the exercises it came up with (`client/components/exercises.json`), and assigned each a colour based on its category.

> Could you give me some more cool down exercises?

The response to this prompt was unhelpful: it elicited more specifics on the cool down exercises it had already told me about, rather than additional exercises.
